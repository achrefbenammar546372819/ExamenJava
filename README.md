## Overview

This repository contains the code for a simple console application developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) university subject. The project focuses on implementing fundamental concepts of OOP to create an e-commerce system with features like user accounts, product management, and secure data storage using SHA-256 hashing.
